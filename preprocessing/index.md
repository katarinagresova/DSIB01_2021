# Quality control and Data preprocessing

This lesson is building on top of previous lesson and you should already have:
- downloaded eCLIP raw sequencing data

This lesson guides you through the starting steps of eCLIP data analysis - quality control, demultiplexing and removal of unwanted sequences.
