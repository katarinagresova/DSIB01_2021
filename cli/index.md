# Intro to Linux and CLI

This lesson is building on top of previous lesson and you should already have:
 - linux environment,
 - github account,
 - forked demo repository from [https://github.com/eliska-chalupova/DSIB01demo](https://github.com/eliska-chalupova/DSIB01demo),
 - local clone of forked repository.

This lesson guides you through the basics of file systems and the command line interface (cli). If you have stored files on a computer at all and recognize the word “file” and either “directory” or “folder” (two common words for the same thing), you’re ready for this lesson.
